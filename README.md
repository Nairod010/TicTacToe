# TicTacToe

This Project is part of the Odin Project runtrough that I am currently in.

## About Project

Curently it's done in JavaScript and a some CSS, I wanted to check how hard it is to make all the html in vanilla JS.

* As a conclusion: It wasn't that hard, but it's a lot of a mess to do this that way,
 meybe there is a better way, but right now that's what I learned
